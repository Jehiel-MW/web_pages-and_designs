# This is a readme file for a digital wall clock

# The clock uses HTML, CSS, and JS for its functionality.

# HTML SECTION

# We have three major DIVs for the project.
# The first DIV is the general DIV for everything the clock needs.
    <div class="general">
        <div class="number">
          <!-- other divs in here -->
        </div>
        <div class="arrows">
          <!-- other divs in here -->
        </div>
        <!-- img tag here -->
        <!-- any other code here -->
    </div>
# The second and third DIV will be inside the first FIV.
# The second DIV is for the numbers which are on the clock.
 # Inside this second DIV, we will have other DIVS which will hold each name with a Class or ID which can be given a reasonable name
 # for example
    <div class="number">
        <div class="twelve">
            12
        </div>
        <div class="six">
            6
        </div>
    </div>
# The third div is for the clock hands which we can arrowroots. We have the seconds hand or arrow, hand or hand or arrow and hours hand or arrow.
# All the arrows or hands will be in the third dive  with the class arrow
# for example
    <div class="arrow">
        <div class="hour">
        </div>
        <div class="second">
        </div>
    </div>
# We will have a company logo for which of the watch company we want to design.


# CSS SECTION

# The first thing is to design the body...
# We will be using Z-Index in the design of this because we want to place something over the other
# We will be using some sudo CSS to bring in some things which are not part of our HTML design
# We transform the design many times based on each DIVS to correctly place the items.
# The position of the major items is very important as well as the items on it.



# JS SECTION

# define all our variables, the hour, minutes, and seconds.
# We will use our JS DOM which is either getElement or querySelector but in this project, the query is used.
# We will define a function which will help us with this function
# The function is to collect the data from our browser and bring it to our function...We then write the code to manipulate this function
# convert the function back aaaa an annananannan, degree
# We will then return this function to our HTML elements.
